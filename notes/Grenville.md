# BL G. 11951-6

## Vol. 1

Photographed preliminary material

Then Pentateuch starting from quire `a`.



## Vol. 5

1. Title page + 3 folios with preliminary material (4 folios).
    - folio 2 is marked `a ii`.
2. Text of NT begins with Matthew marked as `A i`, in same system as noted earlier: QUIRE i, ii, iii, iiii, then two unmarked, then next quire. The penultimate quire is normal: `LL` numbered through `iiii`, then two blanks, so a ternion. *Revelation* and *NT* ends with a sequence `MM v`, two sheets unmaked, and a final unmarked sheet with commendatory poems by Doukas and Vergare.  These presumably form a closing quaternion.
3. *Incipiunt interpretationes*... begin fresh quire marks with `a` through `a vi` followed by 4 unmarked pages, so presumably a quinion (?)
4. *Introductio quam breiuissima ad grecas litteras* starts with quire `a`.
5. Alphabetical Greek-Latin vocabulary, continuing same quire (ie, from `a ii`) organized in normal ternions, quire marks running through `g iii`
