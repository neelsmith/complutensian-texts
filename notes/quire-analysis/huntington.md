# Collation of Huntington copy

## Volume 1


1. initial quaternion. Title page followed by prologue with folios numbered from `+iii` through `+iiii`. Apparently a quaternion with a guard sheet before the title page included in numbering? But folios 7 - 8 are flipped from order in Madrid (and others)? These would be bifolios with a guard sheet and title page.  **Different content in Madrid**: verso to Prolog of Jerome has handwritten text in BNE copy!  Huntington has printed text. (This is folio 7 verso in the Huntington copy, 8 verson in BNE copy)
2. binion: 2 bifolios of corrigenda identified as `a` and `a ii`. These cover the entire Torah.
3. the entire Torah in sequential quires running from `a` - `z`, (no `j`, `u`), `aa` - `zz` and two final quires with special marks. The register on the final recto notes that `Omnes sunt terni excepto ultimo qui est quaternus`. Final verso is blank but has same red frame for planned spaces as pages with content.


## Volume 5

- quarternion: title page folowed by introductory material; only second recto is numbered `a ii`; total of 4 bifolios, same content as Madrid
- the Gospels in continuously  numbered quires `A` - `O` (probably all ternions)
- the travels of Paul in a single ternion `α` with all rectos labelled
- the continuation of the NT from 'R` - `MM` presumably all ternions
- explanations of names in a single gather of 10 bifolios, rectos `a` - `a vi` identified as normal
- intro to Greek with vocabulary, in quires `a` - `g`. The final quire `g` has only three folios, all three rectos explicitly identified.

MM 7 verso has the colophon dating completion to Jan. 10, 1514.

Notes: `A ii verso` has handwritten variant in margin; `A iii recto` has interesting example of alignment extending even to word division! (Follow continuation on to `A iiii verso`)

Notes: spaces for elaborated caps saved and have regular lc version of letter printed but not replaced in many spots e.g., page alpha 1 of volume 2's travels of Paul.

Question: can we hypothesize that ternion `P` was planned for "journeys of Paul" but that it didn't happen and was later (or earlier???) done as a separate ternion `α` (lc alpha) ?
