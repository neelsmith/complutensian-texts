# Align Septuagint and Latin glosses on it

The interior column (on the left side for recto or odd numbered pages, and on the right for verso or even numbered pages) has a text in Greek with Latin glosses directly above. Instead of using footnote-style markers, the Latin glosses are aligned by their position directly above the word they annotate. 

Please prepare a table with 2 columns, one the Greek word or phrase, and one for the Latin word. If a Greek word has no gloss in Latin, leave the Latin column blank.
