# Align Hebrew and Vulgate

I have an image from a page of a 16th century publication in multiple languages. It has marginal notes both on the interior and exterior sides: ignore those. It has three columns of text in the center of the page. The center column is in Latin; the exterior text is in Hebrew. The exterior will be on the right side for recto (odd numbered) pages, and on the left for verso (even numbered) pages. Ignore characters at the end of the Hebrew and Latin columns that serve only to help keep the two versions aligned.

Each word in the Hebrew text has a supralinear alphabetic marker (“a”, “b”, “c”…), positioned like footnote markers, except before the word they mark. When they get to "z", they restart from "a" again. Similar markers before Latin words mean that it corresponds to the Hebrew word with the same marker.

Please prepare a table with 3 columns, one for the marker, one for the Hebrew word and on for the Latin word. If a Hebrew word has no corresponding marker in Latin, leave the Latin column blank. If a Latin word apperas with no marker, include it, but leave the column for marker and the column for the Hebrew word blank.
