DEDICATION TO POPE
- studiosus again in prolog to pope
- did Greek NT first and at same time lexicon!
- then the Hebrew dictionary *before* doing OT
Note form of dictionary. *multiplex significatio* and the index of passags for scholars!
- also need the proper names thing! (Cf text with vol 5 - identical?) Ordered alphabetically (so in Latin transcription whatever the language)
Kind of subtle idea here: proper names don't have the denotative ambiguity of common nouns so can be expressed equivalently in different scripts
- "Added to/joined to" dictionary - literally in same quire??
- Hebrew alphabet and grammar. Grammar based on Hebrew work, only the best sources.
- Best sources for texts in all 3 langg.
